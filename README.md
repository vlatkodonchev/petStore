This is spring boot example project, Rest API for managing Pet Shop store.

This app is using java 17. This is self contained project and can be runned from main method in App class. To run successfully in application.properties file, DB connection string should be update, and DB username and password. 

Iâ€™m currently working with : Java,SpringBoot,Data JPA,RestFULL Web Services and also in this case i use PostgreSQL database.
